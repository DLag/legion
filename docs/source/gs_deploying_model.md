# Deploying models

Legion supports deploying [Legion-compatible models](./gs_what_is_model.md) on top of cluster or on any machine with installed Docker Engine. This chapter describes on-cluster deployment. For local deployment please refer [local mode section](./gs_local_run.md).

**WARNING: Not every Docker Image can be deployed on Legion. Legion only supports deploying of [compatible models](./gs_what_is_model.md#built-model).**
